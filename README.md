### Economy Simulator Summary
#### Developed by Tim Horan
#### Problem Statement: 
We do not have a great way to shock risk beyond a flat multiplier, through specifying some recession and economy characteristics we could stochastically simulate economic outcomes multiple times and collect the average results and confidence intervals.
#### Applications: 
If we got comfortable with some assumptions around what an average Mainstreet recession looks like, the current probability of a recession, and how this probability changes over time as recessions occur or not occur, we could improve our risk shock assessments. For example, we could answer the question is our decision resilient if a recession starts tomorrow?
#### Risks: 
This tool is 100% assumption based, if your assumptions are not well grounded the tools is not helpful!
